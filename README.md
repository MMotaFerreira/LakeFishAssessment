# Lake Fish Assessment App (DeLFI-Site Replica)

This Shiny application replicates the **DeLFI-Site** module used in Germany to assess the ecological status of fish communities in lakes, based on the principles described in the official DeLFI documentation.

## 🔍 What is the DeLFI-Site Module?

The **DeLFI-Site** module is a **site-specific assessment system** that evaluates the ecological status of lakes based on their **fish community**. It compares the **current fish community** with a **modelled reference state**, considering species presence and relative abundance across different habitats and functional guilds.

The system is designed to align with the **EU Water Framework Directive (WFD)** and is one of two main approaches in the DeLFI system:
- **DeLFI-Type**: a type-specific assessment based on gillnet catches
- **DeLFI-Site**: a site-specific assessment using modelled communities (this app replicates this one)

## 📊 Key Features of the App

- Interactive construction of **reference** and **current** fish communities
- Assignment of **abundance classes** to each species:
  - `0`: Absent
  - `1`: Rare
  - `2`: Regular
  - `3`: Frequent
- Calculation of **eight core metrics**:
  - Number of frequent, regular, and rare species
  - Presence of habitat and spawning guilds
  - Abundance of frequent species
  - Abundance distribution within habitat and spawning guilds
- **Optional metrics** included:
  - Bream growth
  - Migrating species
- Final output as:
  - **Total score**
  - **Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR)**
  - **Ecological status class**: High, Good, Moderate, Unsatisfactory, Poor
- Generation of a **printable report**

## 🧠 Scientific Background

The fish community modelling follows these principles:

- **Reference conditions** are constructed from historical records, expert judgment, and nearby water bodies.
- **Current conditions** are modelled using recent (last 6 years) fishery and scientific data, with a full habitat representation (littoral, benthic, pelagic).
- Species are grouped into:
  - **Habitat guilds**: littoral, benthic, epilimnetic, hypolimnetic
  - **Spawning guilds**: lithophilic, psammophilic, phyto-lithophilic, phytophilic
- The scoring system uses a scale of 1 (poor), 3 (moderate), and 5 (high) for each metric.
- The **EQR** is computed from total scores and translated into the final ecological status.

## ▶️ How to Use

1. **Launch the app** (locally or via [shinyapps.io](https://mmotaferreira.shinyapps.io/LakeFishAssessmentApp/)).
2. **Build fish communities**:
   - Add species and set their abundance class for both reference and current conditions.
3. **Review and adjust functional guilds** for habitat and reproduction.
4. **Run assessment**: Metrics are calculated automatically.
5. **Download report** (PDF/HTML) with full evaluation and class boundaries.

1. Install R and RStudio.
2. Install required packages:
   ```r
